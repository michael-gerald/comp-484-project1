                        <em>The Stanger</em> is Billy Joel&apos;s fifth studio album and it was released on September 29&comma; 1977.
                        The album consists of 9 songs and is approximately 42 minutes long. This is probably one of my favorite albums I&apos;ve
                        listened to &lpar;maybe like top 6 or 7&rpar;. Growing up, I remember I would hear Billy Joel songs in my dad's car and until I listened to
                        this album&comma; I would think of Billy Joel as the <q>Piano Man</q> guy. This is one of those albums that I could always go back to&comma; 
                        and I definitely have the past couple of years. Some of my favorites are <em>Scenes from an Italian Restaurant</em>&comma; <em>
                        Vienna</em>&comma; and <em>Just the Way You Are</em>.
