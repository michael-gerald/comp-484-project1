                        <em>Doo&ndash;Wops &amp; Hooligans</em> is Bruno Mars&apos; debut studio album and it was released October 4&comma; 2010.
                        The album consists of 10 songs and is approximately 35 minutes long. Bruno Mars is definitely one of my favorite musical artists
                        and I&apos;ve been a fan of his since I was a kid. I remember my kindergarten class danced to <em>Count on Me</em> &lpar;this songs 
                        in this album&rpar; and 15 years later I&apos;m still bumping my head listening to his songs. This albums a personal favorite of mine&comma; and is 
                        probably my favorite one from his short discography. It&apos;s hard to say which of his albums is my favorite because all of them are good. 
                        But&comma; I&apos;ll go with this one for now because of nostalgia factor. The album has this <q>feels good</q> vibe to it and even if I don't actively listen 
                        to Bruno Mars&comma; I&apos;ll go back and listen to his songs. Some of my favorites from this album are <em>The Lazy Song</em> &lpar;because I&apos;m super
                        lazy&rpar;&comma; <em>Talking to the Moon</em>&comma; and <em>Just the Way You Are</em>. All of the songs in this album are absolute bangers so I recommend
                        listening to it.
