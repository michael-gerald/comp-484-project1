                        <em>In Rainbows</em> is Radiohead&apos; seventh studio album and it was released on October 10&comma; 2007.
                        The album consists of 10 songs and is approximately 43 minutes long. The first time I listened to this album
                        was about 2 years ago and over time&comma; I have come to love the songs in the album more and more. This is one of 
                        the first Radiohead albums I listened to &lpar;can&apos;t remember whether it was this album or <em>The Bends</em> that I first listened to&rpar; 
                        and it made me a fan of them. In my opinion, this album feels more intimate in comparison to their previous works and the constant themes 
                        of love and loss was something that resonated with me. When I first listened to the album&comma; I just thought it sounded good without paying much
                        attention to the meaning of the songs. After a couple months&comma; I listened to the album again and was blown away. As mentioned previously&comma;
                        I&apos;ve come to love the songs in this album the more I listen to them. Some of my personal favorites are <em>Nude</em>&comma; <em>House of Cards</em>&comma; 
                        and <em>Weird Fishes&sol;Arpeggi</em>.
